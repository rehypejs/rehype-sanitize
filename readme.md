[**rehype**][rehype] plugin to sanitize HTML.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-sanitize
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `index.html`:

```html
<div onmouseover="alert('alpha')">
  <a href="jAva script:alert('bravo')">delta</a>
  <img src="x" onerror="alert('charlie')">
  <iframe src="javascript:alert('delta')"></iframe>
  <math>
    <mi xlink:href="data:x,<script>alert('echo')</script>"></mi>
  </math>
</div>
<script>
require('child_process').spawn('rm', ['-r', '-f', process.env.HOME]);
</script>
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
var fs = require('fs')
var rehype = require('rehype')
var merge = require('deepmerge')
var gh = require('hast-util-sanitize/lib/github')
var sanitize = require('rehype-sanitize')

var schema = merge(gh, {tagNames: ['math', 'mi']})

rehype()
  .data('settings', {fragment: true})
  .use(sanitize, schema)
  .process(fs.readFileSync('index.html'), function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```html
<div>
  <a>delta</a>
  <img src="x">

  <math>
    <mi></mi>
  </math>
</div>
```

## API

### `rehype().use(sanitize[, schema])`

Remove potentially dangerous things from HTML, or more correct: keep only safe
the things in a document.

###### `schema`

The sanitation schema defines how and if nodes and properties should be cleaned.
The schema is documented in [`hast-util-sanitize`][schema].

## Security

Improper use of `rehype-sanitize` can open you up to a
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack.
The defaults *are* safe, but deviating from them is likely *unsafe*.

Use `rehype-sanitize` *after* all other plugins, as other plugins are likely
also unsafe.
